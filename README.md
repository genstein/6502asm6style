# MOS 6502 ASM6 Syntax Highlighting

This is a syntax highlighting package for Sublime Text 2.

It provides highlighting for [MOS 6502](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) assembly language, specifically for the [ASM6](http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/) variant.

To install, clone this repo into a folder within your Sublime Text 2 packages folder, for instance

	C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages

The .tmLanguage file may be edited by hand to make changes, but for best results (and esp. if submitting pull requests), edit **only** the YAML-tmLanguage file and regenerate using [AAAPackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev).

The exact path will depend on your system. Happy highlighting!
